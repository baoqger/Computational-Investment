Computational investing, Part1 is a very popular project provided on the platform of Coursera. (And it is also the first certification with verified signature I got from Coursera platform)
In this project, you can play stock market data with Python, especially some powerful data processing modules, like Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, QSTK(QuantSoftware ToolKit). 
If you have interest to be a “quant” (already many mysterious and exciting stories about quant on Internet), this project maybe can show you a little piece of what it will be like. In fact this project doesn’t emphasis too much about math and financial theory, instead it more focus on automatic trading by programming skill. 
Generally there are 7 programming tasks included in this project:
	Task 1: Assess and optimize a portfolio: 
	Task 2: Event Studies: 
	Task 3: Build a Market Simulator: 
	 Task 4: Event Study into Simulator 
	Task 5: Implement Bollinger Bands 
	 Task 6: Event Study with Bollinger Bands 
	Task 7: Back Test with Bollinger Bands 
In detail you can find more information in the following wiki:

Based on the content of this project, it’s easier for you to expand the functionality of your code, if you have some ideas. For me I implemented statistical arbitrage, which is a typical algorithm trading method in quant fied d, based on the set up platform. For this part, another repository will publish later.
